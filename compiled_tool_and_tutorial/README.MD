# Tool Usage

At first, the CommonRunTutorialAndCompiledTool contains the compiled version of the tool. 

Follow the instruction in that directory to run tool for the simplest case. 

If the simplest case is successfully start up, replace the to-be-test exe with the exe in Test-Prefix directory. 

# Usage Warning
The machine under test is bought 3 years ago, and AVX instruction set (max 256 bit) is supported, the AVX512 instruction set (max 512 bit) is supported but not tested. 
If your machine is bought in recent 1 or 2 years, it may support AVX512 and I will throw exception if AVX512 instructions are encountered as they are not tested on my machine. 

# Use of WinTaintCE
1.  Download DynamoRIO（https://dynamorio.org/page_releases.html）, put it in somewhere, extract the drrun.exe absolute path, assume it is "C:/HomeSpace/BinaryAnalysis/DynamoRIO-Windows-10.0.0/bin64/drrun.exe", this path will be used in step 3. 

2.	Download the executable file of the Winlib library on our open-source WinTaintCE GitHub.

3.  In this version, we only offer functionality to generate test cases for one initial seed. To loop the procedure, please write a script by your own. 
3.1	Randomly select one seed file as input to WinTaintCE, and they should be put into an empty directory, here is "C:/HomeSpace/BinaryFuzzInput" in this tutorial.

    The following line is the command line:

    C:/HomeSpace/CTaintAnalysis/yyx_trace_taint/run-env/run-pack/yyx_trace_taint.exe -drrun_path "C:/HomeSpace/BinaryAnalysis/DynamoRIO-Windows-10.0.0/bin64/drrun.exe" -exe_path  "C:/HomeSpace/CTaintAnalysis/yyx_trace_taint/run-env/simple-example/libfile-simple.exe" -yyx_taint_dll_path "C:/HomeSpace/CTaintAnalysis/yyx_trace_taint/run-env/yt-pack/yyx_taint.dll" -folder_put_instr_val_trace  "C:/HomeSpace/BinarySymbolicOutput" -folder_put_generated_seeds "C:/HomeSpace/BinaryFuzzInput" -folder_put_temp_generated_seeds "C:/HomeSpace/BinaryFuzzTempInput"
	
	The exe path "C:/HomeSpace/CTaintAnalysis/yyx_trace_taint/run-env/simple-example/libfile-simple.exe" is the program to be tested. 
	
	The three directory "C:/HomeSpace/BinaryFuzzTempInput", "C:/HomeSpace/BinaryFuzzTempInput" and "C:/HomeSpace/BinarySymbolicOutput" should be created to be an empty directory before running the above command. 
	The directory "C:/HomeSpace/BinaryFuzzTempInput" is the directory where the seeds generated by concolic execution are put. 

    Note that you should replace the absolute path such as 'C:/HomeSpace/CTaintAnalysis/yyx_trace_taint/run-env/' to your absolute path which puts the necessary materials.
    We print the origin non-taint trace in this time to let reviewers see origin trace length. 
    The taint analysis is shown offline to let reviewers see the taint details.
